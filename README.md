# iloc-vscode

This is an extension that provides syntax highlighting for the RISC linear assembly code language ILOC.

Currently it only works for "conventional" naming of registers and labels:
- registers start with r followed by alphanumeric characters or hyphen.
- labels start with L followed by a positive integer number

You may post an issue and I'll take a look, but I don't promise to work on it until I have free time (probably never ðŸ˜­)
